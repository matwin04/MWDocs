### 1. A Brief History of the Photographic Lens  
[A Charles Louis Chevalier and the Story of a Lens Legacy (Lomography)](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/328315-charles-chevalier-and-the-story-of-a-lens-legacy)
- **Who**: Charles Louis Chevalier, his father Jacques‑Louis‑Vincent Chevalier  
- **What**: First useful achromatic doublet lenses—reduced chromatic aberration  
- **When**: Circa 1835–1839; first practical lens in 1835  
- **Where**: Paris, France  
- **Why**: Needed faster, sharper lenses for Daguerre’s invention  
- **How**: Cemented crown-and-flint glass doublet design

### 2. History of the Photographic Lens Design  
[Wikipedia – History of photographic lens design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photographic_lens_design)
- **Who**: Charles Chevalier; Joseph Petzval; Paul Rudolph; Zeiss/Abbe; Taylor‑Hobson  
- **What**: Lens evolution from meniscus to achromat, Petzval, Tessar, Cooke Triplet, double Gauss, zoom, coatings  
- **When**: 1800s–1980+ (e.g. Petzval 1840, Tessar 1902, Cooke Triplet 1893, modern zooms 1950s–80s)  
- **Where**: France, Austria, Germany, UK, Japan, USA  
- **Why**: To correct aberrations, increase aperture, introduce zoom, improve coatings  
- **How**: Mathematical design, new glass, cemented elements, aspheres, multicoating

[Wikipedia – Petzval Portrait lens section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photographic_lens_design#Petzval_Portrait_lens)
- **Who**: Joseph Petzval (mathematician), Voigtländer (manufacturer)  
- **What**: First fast portrait lens, f/3.6 aperture, four‑element air‑spaced achromat  
- **When**: Designed 1840, produced 1841  
- **Where**: Vienna, Austria; used widely across Europe  
- **Why**: To shorten portrait exposures from hours to minutes  
- **How**: Optical calculation; front cemented + rear air‑spaced elements

- **Who**: Lens designers, optical engineers (e.g., Taylor‑Hobson)  
- **What**: Anatomy of modern lenses—multiple elements, coatings, groups  
- **When**: Article dated **June 5, 2025**; trends span from mid‑20th century to today  
- **Where**: Global lens design and manufacturing (UK, Japan, Germany, USA)  
- **Why**: To improve sharpness, reduce aberrations, weight, and size  
- **How**: Combining optical formulas, advanced glass, coatings, compact engineering

### 5. What Does a Petzval Lens Do?  
[Filmmakers Academy – What Does a Petzval Lens Do?](https://example.com/what-does-a-petzval-lens-do)
- **Who**: Original lens makers (Petzval/Voigtländer); modern filmmakers, Lomography enthusiasts  
- **What**: Swirly bokeh, dreamy aesthetics, soft edges  
- **When**: 1840s original; resurgence in recent years  
- **Where**: Origin in Europe; now popular globally with indie creatives  
- **Why**: For distinctive artistic effect instead of clinical sharpness  
- **How**: Field curvature and optical design cause characteristic “swirl”
