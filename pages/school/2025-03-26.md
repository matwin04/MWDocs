# Quiz 1 Notes

## 1 General Concepts
### 1.1 What is Data?
- Fundamental unit of information
- Represented in Binary
- can be text, numbers, auido, video...
- must be stored, processed, and transmitted by computers.
### 1.2 What Is a Data Structure
- Organizes data in **main memory** (RAM)
- helps with efficency, modification, and storage
- Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Ques, Trees, Graphs
## 2 Types of Data Structures
### 2.1 Linear
- Sequential Data Arrangement
- Easy to implement and traverse
- Examples: Array, Linked List, Stack Queue
### 2.2 Non-Linear
- Data is stored hirearcically or interconnected
- Can represent complex relationships
- Examples: Tree, Graph

## 3 Why Study Data Structures?
- To improve effeciency of software
- Enables better problem solving and algorthims
- Helps with understanding time and space complexity
## 4. Pseudocode
- Describes algorithms in readable, language-agnostic format.
- Should be easier and cleaner enough for someone to implement in code
- Includes loops, conditionals, and clear steps
- Example Task: Finding a max value in a list
## 5. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Review
### 5.1 Key Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Grouping data and Methods 
- **Abstraction**: Hifing internal implementation.
- **Inheritance**: Sharing code through class hierarchies.
- **Polymorphism**: One function behaves differently based on input type.
- **Code Reuse**: Avoid Redundancy.
### 5.2 C++ Specifics
- `struct` **vs** `class`: a `struct` has public members by default
- `const` **modifier**:Prevents modification of data
- Global variables should be avoided in OOP
- Seperate compilation with .h and .cpp files
- Friend Functions: Allow acess to private members.

## 6 Pointers and Memory
- **Pointers**:Stores the memory address of a variable
- **Dereferencing (`*ptr`)**: Accesses the value at the pointer's memory address.
- **New/Delete**: Allocate and free memory dynamically
- Memory Segments:
    - Text (code)
    - Data (initalized and unintialized)
    - Heap (Dynamic)
    - Stack (Function Calls)
## 7 Linked Lists
### 7.1 Key Concepts
- **Nodes:** Are the building blocks: containing data + pointer.
- Memory is **not** contiguous
- Acess elements is **sequential**, not by index
### 7.2 Operations
| operation name             | description                              | time complexity |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `isEmpty`                  | Checks if the list empty                 | $O(1)$          |
| `addToFront`               | Adds node at the front(head)             | $O(1)$          |
| `removeFront`              | Removes the noe from the front           | $O(1)$          |
| `addAtBack`                | Adds node at the end                     | $O(n)$          |
| `elementAt(index)`         | Returns Data at specific specified index | $O(n)$          |
| `insertAt(position,value)` | add node at specific index               | $O(n)$          |

## 8. The Big Three(C++)
- Refferes to the **three special member functions** that manage memory:
	- Copy Constructor
	- Assignment Opperator
	- Destructor
- If your class uses dynamic memory(eg with `new`) you must properly implement these to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior.
- With C++ and later, **Rule of Five** adds:
	- Move Constructor
	- Move Assignment Opperator
## 9. Time Complexity Overview

| **Complexity Notation** | **Meaning**      | **Example**           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| O(1)                    | Constant time    | Accessing array index |
| O(n)                    | Linear time      | Searching a list      |
| O(log n)                | Logarithmic time | Binary search         |
| O(nÂ²)                   | Quadratic time   | Bubble sort           |
| O(n log n)              | Log-linear time  | Merge sort            |
|                         |                  |                       |
