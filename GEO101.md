In recent times the African continent has been rapidly developing and changing from what it once was.  This is due to the outside investments of two of the worlds largest superpowers, the US and China.  One of the most well known misconceptions regarding the so-called Chinese Debt trap.  While there are valid concerns about the transparency, sustainability, and China's own actions at home when it comes to their way of government, this narrative is a oversimplification of a much more complex relationship.  Many African governments actively seek investment from China since it usually comes with less political strings and requirements than those from the West.  China has funded major infrastructure projects that support economic growth and connectivity, and this is huge especially in areas that have been historically neglected by western colonialism of the past.  aIn terms of US relations with the African continent, the lack of a more equal and robust economic partnership can be attributed to both historical and current geopolitical factors.  The west often viewed the continent though a lens of aid and security rather than mutual economic opportunity.  However while some of this is still very true and very prevalent, especially in the poorest and most remote places in Africa.  China however presents itself as more of an economic partner to the continent, compared to the US which tends to focus more on humanitarian and aid functions.  Additionally, domestic politcal tentions and a lack of a long-term foreign policy plan make it difficult for the US to prioritize Africa in the way that China does.  Especially now in a age of budget cuts, and defunding things that don't align with the current views of the current administration, has allowed China to gain more influence in the region, closing off the US to more economic opportunities abroad.
